* REQUIREMENTS: Numpy library must be available and configured properly. 
* NOTICE:
  - This code was written using Python 3.x. It was tested on Spyder 3.x. 
  - The implementation generates results for the covariance matrix, capacity, duality gap/ relative objective error, and number of iterations.
